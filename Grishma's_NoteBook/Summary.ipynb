    "## Predicting Stock Prices of Ford Using SVM Models\n",
    "This project explores the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to predict stock prices of Ford Motor Company, employing both Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Support Vector Classification (SVC). The goal is to forecast future stock prices using regression techniques and to classify stock price movements (up or down) using classification techniques. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the methodology and key differentiating factors between SVR and SVC."

    "## 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "Summary: Historical stock price data was collected and preprocessed. Key features like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and volume data were extracted. Missing values were imputed, and data was scaled for consistency using z-score normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVR Use Case: The scaled features and target variable (actual stock prices) were prepared for regression tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC Use Case: A new binary target variable (Price_Change) was created, indicating whether the stock price would go up (1) or stay the same/go down (0) the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis: Preprocessing is critical for both SVR and SVC since SVMs are sensitive to feature scaling. Creating a binary classification target for SVC allows the method to focus on directional movement instead of exact price values."

    "Hyperparameters such as C (regularization), epsilon (tolerance). The features were preprocessed using standardization and power transformation to ensure optimal model performance. A linear kernel SVR model with tuned hyperparameters (C=1 and epsilon=0.01) was selected through time-series cross-validation and grid search, with the evaluation focusing on minimizing mean squared error (MSE). For testing, the last week of data was reserved as an unseen test set. The model achieved a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.0081, demonstrating its accuracy in predicting short-term stock trends. The SVR model effectively captures the nuances in Ford's stock movements, providing actionable insights for financial decision-making.\n",

    "\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Support Vector Regression (SVR) model was subjected to backtesting to evaluate its robustness and predictive capability over multiple time periods. The following steps were taken:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preparation:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was divided into rolling windows for training and testing.\n",
    "Each backtest used the previous 2 months (approximately 60 days) as the training window, and the following 5 days as the test period.\n",
    "Features and target (F_Close_pred) were scaled and transformed to remove skewness using StandardScaler and PowerTransformer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "A grid search with TimeSeriesSplit cross-validation was performed to optimize the SVR hyperparameters (kernel, C, and epsilon).\n",
    "The best parameters were identified for each training window and used to train the SVR model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtesting Framework:\n",
    "\n",
    "Rolling backtesting was conducted over 10 iterations.\n",
    "After training the model on the 2-month training window, predictions were made for the 5-day test period.\n",
    "Metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R² (coefficient of determination) were calculated for each backtest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "Predictions for each backtest were plotted alongside actual values, providing a visual representation of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "Average Metrics Across 10 Backtests:\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE: 0.0563\n",
    "\n",
    "RMSE: 0.1936\n",
    "\n",
    "R²: -1.1683\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtesting Outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The MSE and RMSE indicate a moderate error in predicting the exact stock prices.\n",
    "The negative R² value for most backtests suggests that the model struggled to explain the variance in stock price movement compared to the mean of the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "While the SVR model produced predictions with relatively low RMSE, the negative R² scores highlight the challenges in modeling stock price dynamics, which are inherently noisy and influenced by external factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Backtest Visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The plots demonstrated that the SVR model could track trends in certain periods but failed to capture abrupt changes or outliers, which are common in financial data.\n",
    "Challenges in Predicting Stock Prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stock prices often exhibit high volatility, influenced by market sentiment, external news, and macroeconomic factors. The linear SVR model, despite its predictive power, may have limitations in capturing such non-linear and unpredictable patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Potential Improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating more advanced models, such as non-linear kernels (e.g., RBF), ensemble methods, or deep learning models, might improve performance.\n",
    "Including additional features, such as macroeconomic indicators or sentiment analysis, could provide the model with more context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "The backtesting results show that the SVR model can provide reasonable predictions but struggles to fully capture the complex and dynamic nature of stock price movements. While the model performs well during periods of stability, its performance degrades during volatile phases. Future work could focus on enhancing feature engineering and leveraging more sophisticated models to achieve better predictive accuracy and robustness.\n"

    "Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC was used to classify whether the stock price would increase (1) or not (0). The Support Vector Classification (SVC) model was implemented to predict the class of Ford's stock closing price (F_Close_pred_class) over a two-month window. The dataset was preprocessed by standardizing and transforming features using the StandardScaler and PowerTransformer to remove skewness. The dataset was split, keeping the last 7 days as an unseen test set. A time-series cross-validation (TimeSeriesSplit) was used for hyperparameter tuning. The parameter grid for the grid search included different kernel types (linear, rbf), regularization parameter C, and gamma values.\n",

    "The optimal hyperparameters found through grid search were:\n",
    "\n",
    "kernel: linear\n",
    "\n",
    "C: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "gamma: 0.01\n",

    "The final SVC model was trained using these parameters, and predictions were generated for the unseen test set. Accuracy and Mean Squared Error (MSE) were used to evaluate performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC is designed for classification tasks and finds a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes (price up vs. not up).\n",

It simplifies the problem by focusing on directional movement, reducing the complexity of price forecasting. It does not provide exact price values, limiting its use in specific financial applications.\n",

However, the transitions in the binary values (0 to 1 or vice versa) highlight a sharp fluctuation in stock class predictions. This volatility may represent the sensitivity of the SVC model to decision boundaries, which aligns with its role in classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SVC model demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for classifying Ford's stock price movements, achieving an accuracy of 85.7%. While the MSE of 0.1429 suggests slight discrepancies in exact class predictions, the overall performance is robust for short-term forecasting. The binary nature of the classification task, as seen in the plot, emphasizes the model's focus on distinguishing between upward and downward movements.\n",
