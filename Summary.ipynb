    "## Predicting Stock Prices of Ford Using SVM Models\n",
    "This project explores the application of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to predict stock prices of Ford Motor Company, employing both Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Support Vector Classification (SVC). The goal is to forecast future stock prices using regression techniques and to classify stock price movements (up or down) using classification techniques. Below is a step-by-step breakdown of the methodology and key differentiating factors between SVR and SVC."

    "## 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "Summary: Historical stock price data was collected and preprocessed. Key features like moving averages, relative strength index (RSI), and volume data were extracted. Missing values were imputed, and data was scaled for consistency using z-score normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVR Use Case: The scaled features and target variable (actual stock prices) were prepared for regression tasks.\n",
    "SVC Use Case: A new binary target variable (Price_Change) was created, indicating whether the stock price would go up (1) or stay the same/go down (0) the next day.\n",
    "Analysis: Preprocessing is critical for both SVR and SVC since SVMs are sensitive to feature scaling. Creating a binary classification target for SVC allows the method to focus on directional movement instead of exact price values."

    "## 2. SVR: Predicting Stock Prices\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVR was applied to predict the continuous values of stock prices. The kernel functions tested include:\n",
    "Linear: Assumes a linear relationship between features and target.\n",
    "RBF (Radial Basis Function): Captures nonlinear relationships by mapping data to higher dimensions.\n",
    "Hyperparameters such as C (regularization), epsilon (tolerance), and kernel parameters were optimized using GridSearchCV.\n",
    "Differentiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVR aims to minimize the prediction error while allowing some deviation (epsilon) from the true price\n",
    "SVR solves a regression problem and focuses on finding a hyperplane that fits most data points within a margin of tolerance.\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Metrics: \n",
    "Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) were used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Findings: \n",
    "SVR performed best with the RBF kernel, capturing nonlinear patterns in stock price data. The linear kernel showed lower accuracy due to the inherent nonlinearity in stock market data."

    "## 3. SVC: Classifying Stock Price Movements\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC was used to classify whether the stock price would increase (1) or not (0). The following steps were performed:\n",
    "Kernel Selection: Linear and RBF kernels were tested.\n",
    "Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV was used to find the optimal C and kernel parameters.\n",
    "Train-Test Split: Data was divided into training and testing sets, ensuring temporal order for time-series integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differentiation:\n",
    "\n",
    "SVC is designed for classification tasks and finds a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between classes (price up vs. not up).\n",
    "Unlike SVR, which predicts continuous values, SVC predicts categorical outcomes, focusing on decision boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score were used to assess performance.\n",
    "Findings: The RBF kernel outperformed the linear kernel, reflecting the complex relationships in the stock price movements."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "This project demonstrates the versatility of SVMs in stock market prediction, with SVR excelling in regression tasks and SVC effectively classifying price movements. While both approaches have their strengths, their combined use provides a comprehensive strategy for understanding and forecasting stock market behavior."
